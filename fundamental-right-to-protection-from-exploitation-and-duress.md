## Fundamental Right to Protection from Exploitation and Duress

Currently, when a victim of blackmail due to a hospital's bad behaviors, calls the local police in Hyderabad, India, the police and the hospital managers gang up on the victim to blame and shame the person being extorted. The distressed victim is blamed and bullied by them, and is labeled by them as "a person who is 'unwilling' to pay for the 'high quality' medical goods and services given at 'nominal prices' from having 'ill intentions' to defraud the corporate entity." 

So, what use is it for any victim or the victim's guardian, to ever call the police, at any point in time, regarding malpractices of healthcare and other services providers?

Police inspectors in Hyderabad, India, may plead excuses for being deficient in their understanding of chartered accounting and insurance rules concerning hospitals and educational institutions. Also, Consumer Forums in India may plead excuses for not having the jurisdictional capabilities and resources, or the jurisprudence for addressing any of the culpable activities discovered within "unfair trade practices" of a corporate entity. But even then, every Citizen, Resident, and Visitor in India, has a Fundamental Right to protection from being exploited as a chattel or a stock, especially from the exploitation being done by harmful and injurious trade practices of identifiable, nefarious corporate entities.  

At present, **the Constitution of India** doesn't explicitly provide any wordings in *Articles 23 and 24,* about the culpability of activities that cause or promote the exploitation of human beings, organs and body parts, biological samples such as sperm and ovum, and of dead bodies (particularly as a collateral property controlled by a corporate entity). However, other statutes of procedural laws in India, do prescribe the punishments for endangering the lives of people due to various and several types of activities, especially in the context of the lives of vulnerable persons legally categorized as minors, disabled people, the elderly, and the infirm. 

So, is the *Consumer Protection Act of 2019 with its amendments up to 2024,* in derogation to all those ***foundational principals and statutes of the law, such as Article 21 of the Constitution of India,*** that are intended for the safety, well being, and protection of Visitors, Residents, and Citizens? Or is the underlying problem, due to the way in which the *Consumer Protection Act* is being interpreted and implemented by practitioners in the legal industry, that is contradictory to fundamental duties of Public Servants in India who are responsible for curtailing and preventing organized crimes? 

Yes, the ways in which numerous hospitals and clinics throughout the nation are still able to harm naive patients on a daily basis, while creating public health hazards by normalizing their corporate-policy-based behaviour of holding patients and dead bodies, as leverage against healthcare "Consumers", and that too for amassing unearned monies, have only ever been possible due to the complacency and apathy breading among few higher authorities in India. How else could those culpable corporate managers and medical practitioners, ever have had the gall, to do such vile things that even Ravana wouldn't have dared to do? 

As such, the Crime Investigation Department (CID), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), and all other concerned agencies and directorates in India, don't even need to do a sting operation, or commission a probe, because if either of them were to go to any major corporate hospitals in Telangana or New Delhi, the corporate bosses and managers of those hospitals will arrogantly and pretentiously defend their purported "right to not discharge the patient" until and after the payment of non-invoiced bills are settled by the patient's next-of-kin. Those non-invoiced bills for post-paid goods and services were never proper to begin with. And many corporations across industry sectors, have been taking undue advantages of a lack of Consumer Awareness about healthcare and fundamental rights, among the general public in India. 

Additionally, inpatients were and are, always under the physical and managerial control of the healthcare provider's members including the medical practitioners, managers, and support staff, due to the: 

1. designs of the healthcare provider's enterprise resources and,  

2. policy based functions of the healthcare provider's trained and coordinated staff. 

Plainly and obviously, the patients (or dead bodies or biological samples) were, and are being put under automatic confinement and restraint, inside the healthcare provider's building by its members, upon the patient (or dead body or biological samples) not being given timely discharge to exit the building with the rightful guardian. This type of wrongful behaviours and activities being committed by the coordinated actions between medical practitioners, support staff, managers, board members, and enterprise resources of a healthcare provider, constitutes the organized crime of premeditated extortion via abduction and wrongful confinement of vulnerable persons (or dead bodies or biological samples). 

These types of cases involving wrongful captivity of patients for "debt recovery" are not only a case of medical negligence on part of medical practitioners, in failing to protect the safety and well being of patients as a priority. These are ongoing criminal cases of deliberate violations and non-bailable offenses being committed throughout states like Telangana and New Delhi, by medical practitioners in corporate hospitals and clinics, because of complicit Medical Councils and Accreditation Boards, and because of their willful dereliction of duty to protect the patient. The patients and their family are made to suffer by causing distress to the involuntarily detained person, or by threatening to destroy the cunningly captured dead body. Such belligerent crimes involving national and international victims are being orchestrated via medical practitioners and managerial staff belonging to particular groups of corporate healthcare providers in India, for the simple purposes of greedily extracting unearned money from the snared victim's family. 

A worse form of organized crime is being committed by a number of healthcare providers in Telangana and New Delhi, in India, which involves the coordinated and deliberate actions of executive officers belonging to Central Government's "Autonomous Institutes" such as Central Universities, that results in cheating and defrauding of Central Government employees, scholars, and retirees, via extortion and blackmail at so-called "Referral Hospitals." Those Referral Hospitals are most often, also accredited as "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Hospitals." This is a high crime of the most profound magnitude and insidiousness, that has been rampant among various states of India, since decades!  

>**As such, which statute of the laws in India, or any portion of the rules set by medical councils or the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), gave those medical practitioners and corporate managers of hospitals and clinics a "right" to place a lien on the patient, or to use human beings and dead bodies and biological samples as leverage, for debt collection?** 

What is supposed to be the oath-bound duty of medical practitioners and managers of a hospital, in the event when a patient or the patient's family members are *unable* to pay the healthcare vendor's post-paid bills for healthcare goods and services that have already been rendered and consumed? 

Similarly, in the event when the patient or the patient's family members are *unwilling* to settle the given bills, for any reason what-so-ever, what is the oath-bound duty of the healthcare corporation's members? 

In either of the above-mentioned situations, is it the duty of the healthcare provider's members to place their pecuniary interests, above the interests of the patient's safety, fundamental rights, constitutional freedoms, and well being?  

Worst of all, the Consumers of every fertility clinic already suffer ["vendor lock-in"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) as soon as they start the medical procedures for giving their biological samples into the custody of the clinic. So, if or when, a fertility clinic suddenly jacks up the price for storage of those biological samples with the placid threat of not returning or even destroying those biological samples, particularly as a "custodian" of those vital and precious haploid cells, what are the distressed and locked-in Consumers to do in that situation? Those haploid cells or fertilized zygotes aren't even defined as "a person" in the eyes of procedural and constitutional laws in India. Existing rules and laws pertaining to the concept of "Habeas Corpus" are not even applicable to haploid cells and zygotes. As such, if anybody holds a zygote in captivity for extortion, is it abduction? And, if anybody in a clinic kills a zygote that is not yet a fetus, is it a murder? 

With all these reasons and sinful situations being kept in view and taken into account, which court of law or judicial body can correctly mange to address the importance of those haploid cells, zygotes, or fetuses, for individuals who are under peril of losing their opportunity for parenthood? 

More importantly, at what cost in time and money and emotional suffering, to those aggrieved Consumers as Citizens or Residents or Visitors, will a court of law be able to deliver judgment orders in the interests of protecting individual rights and promoting social justice, particularly after those victims have already suffered irreparable damages and harms from not only losing their unborn child, but also from a permanent injury to their ability to conceive ever again, because of a greedy fertility clinic's unchecked malpractices in broad daylight? 

It is evident that only particular and certain individuals who identify themselves as upper-caste Hindu "elites" in India (among medical practitioners, lawyers, police, law enforcement agents, financiers, insurers, underwriters, corporate managers, auditors, judges, bureaucrats, and ministers), have collectively created this normalized culture of holding people belonging to communities of religious minorities, Aadivasi, Dalit, and socio-economically oppressed classes in India, as chattel for enforcing debt collection, through cunningly tortuous methods. It is as if those so-called elites are begging for deadly riots to engulf everything, from Kanya Kumari to Amritsar.

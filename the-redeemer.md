>Comfortably oblivious people can only head towards oblivion. 

To step out of the comfort provided by obliviousness, to correctly ascertain one's bearings in order to discern the right directional heading, one needs to withstand the burden of holding verifiable truths, within open palms, and to similarly receive aid from The Divine, with an open heart. 

To grasp a truth, with tightly clasped fists, within one's palms, can become agonizingly painful, especially when the truth being held onto, happens to be analogous to white-hot coal. So, it is wise to be able to let go of a truth with open palms, when it is too painful to bear. But in doing so, one does not relinquish the learning derived from painful truths, to yet again adopt stupidity or carelessness. 

For example, the horrors and terrors inflicted upon innocent people by colonial and supremacist forces, is indeed a painful truth for Canadian citizens to admit and accept, and to then prominently maintain the learning from that truth, within Canada's collective conscience. Ignoring, denying, undercutting, downplaying, or sidelining those truths, for moving onto becoming comfortably numb and oblivious, is cowardly, disgraceful, shameful, condescendingly contemptuous, deceitful, conceited, and unforgivably wrong, because doing so, dishonors the lives and respective heritage of countless survivors, and victims, of colonialism and predatory capitalism. 

Moreover, that type of obliviousness continues to deprive survivors of state-sponsored violence, the long-overdue restitution and reparation owed by beneficiaries of those state-sponsored crimes. Worst of all, that type of ignorance and cultural misappropriation causes the inter-generational harms from colonial ideologies to compound, and to spread throughout the modern era in the form of unrepentant racism and bigotry. 

There isn't a way to let go of things, without letting it all out. However, there aren't any accessible ways to even utter a number of things, out-loud to anyone, such as details of [the unethical experiments being conducted on human subjects,](https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice/blob/main/expose/08-1.md#81-unethical-experiments-conducted-on-human-beings) within on-campus and off-campus labs of North American universities, and within other state-sponsored facilities run by Northern Atlantic alliances in various countries. So, those unmentionable things can never be let go of by survivors and victims, which the sadistic torturers and violators of targeted individuals know all to well, along with an awareness of what that kind of a burden eventually does to a human being. 

There is no form of virtue that allows the persistence and spread of: corruption, bigotry, ignorance, or the violation of basic human rights through any type of genocidal or murderous activities. 

A society devoid of such basic and foundational ethics, is bound to be harrowed in due course of time by The Redeemer, that is, Allah al Kareem ar Raheem, al Waasi al-á¸¤asib wal Muqaddim.

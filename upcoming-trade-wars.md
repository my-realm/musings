## Upcoming Trade Wars

Creating and maintaining healthy boundaries, with megalomaniacs who think they own and rule the whole world, is practically impossible. That is why, the citizens of all countries on Earth have continued to suffer because of the toxicity of: British Monarchy and American "Manifest Destiny." 

A British Prime Minister along with their King or Queen, and an American President along with their Senate, invariably screws over every country of the planet, merely because of their greed for "global primacy, supremacy, and dominance." 

And a 'President' Trump, would definitely screw over the British as well, as soon as it becomes convenient for him to do so. 

Worse, Trump as a president would push the overloaded German economy further towards breaking point by demanding that Germany contribute more of its GDP towards NATO, with a threat of the US withdrawing from NATO if Germany doesn't obey Trump's dictum.  

And then, the world would lose exports from Germany with the German economy collapsing due to America's hard-nosed Trumpian foreign policies. Trump, of course, would then try to fill that vacuum in international trade by trying to sell "Made in America" goods. 

But, American and Canadian manufacturing can never meet the greater standards of German high-precision engineering because unlike North Americans, German workers haven't been ruined by Walmart-culture.  

Is there a store worse than Walmart that causes degradation of the quality of goods being sold to consumers by engendering lower economic standards and stagnant wages for employees, along with poorer employment conditions for their contractually hired workers? Yes, apart from Amazon's Fulfillment and Shipping Centers, the poorer quality store, is called Canadian Tire. Of course, the much worse stores like Sears along with Bed-Bath-and-Beyond have already gone bankrupt. 

Will Trump's ultra right-wing policies hollow out US federal institutions and turn them into an empty shell of their former existence if he becomes president? Yes. Which means that the likes of Walmart, Amazon, etc. will grow to exploit workers much more ruthlessly, and minimum wages in the US might also go down. 

It wouldn't be surprising if Trump legalizes child labor in agriculture, crude oil, textile, construction, and in mining industries, and also in all retail sectors, so that American corporations can increase their profits by exploiting young orphans and refugees. 

So, I say that every eligible voter in the USA, ought to go vote for Trump, to re-elect him as the next President of the United States of America; because why should anybody ever care about health and well being of the huddled masses and of vulnerable ecosystems, right?

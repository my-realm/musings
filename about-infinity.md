## On the idea of different sizes of "infinity."

From [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor#Set_theory)'s proof, which demonstrated how a bijective function can exist between the set of natural numbers and real ones, as well as from sets like odd natural numbers, to the set of all complex numbers, it is sufficiently evident that different collections that contain infinite number of elements within them, seem to eventually have the same, "unfathomable size", of an infinitely large quantity of constituent elements, even when the very same type of mathematical proof indicates that the "cardinality" of the set of real numbers is distinctly greater than that of the set of natural numbers. 

So let us now rearticulate the question about comparing the size of different collections with infinite elements, to: "which collection with infinitely many items, grows faster than the other?" 

For example, if we consider a finite plane square, and construct a bijection from each point on that surface, to the points on a finite cube, we will see that there just might be sufficiently many dots within a finite 2-D square, that correspond in a one-to-one manner, to the dots on the surface of a finite, 3-D cube. The planar square or rhombus, need not even be equal in its area to the overall surface area of the cube or cuboid shape, in this example, as long as the square's area isn't greater than the cube's surface area to begin with. The next thing we can do, is to expand the size of the planar object to increase its area towards infinity, while we simultaneously increase the volume of the cuboid object, such that a one unit increase in length-times-breadth of the planar object, corresponds to a one unit increase in length-times-breadth-times-height of the cuboid object. So, the outer surface area of the cuboid object must certainly grow faster than the planar object's area, with each step-wise increase in the linear span, along each principal axis of the mathematical objects being considered, which may be allowed to grow indefinitely. 

In this discussion, the presented "thought experiment" is for guessing, the number of finite step-wise increments in the linear span of each object's size along its principle axes, after which, the respective rate of increase towards infinity would feel like an equivalent rate. Or, would the rates of increase towards the ultimate realm of infinity, forever remain unequal, even after infinitely many incremental steps taken towards increasing the size of each shape's bounding area?  

My eventual conclusion from pondering about the rate of change within a collection of things, which would necessarily cause a transformation in the included contents of the collection, is that: an infinite rate of change in the flux of energy or matter, within a neighborhood of Earth's solar system, would have ripped up the solar system. So it seems nice, that there hasn't been any physical reason or phenomenon, because of which, an infinite rate of change of energy or matter, passing through a unit sized area or volume of space, at Earth, or within the planet's neighborhood, would ever be observed. What then is causing the definiteness of flux to persist, within each portion of the space in and around our planet? What are the minimum and maximum bounds on different types of flux, at known physical conditions that can be measured or observed accurately, and precisely? 

Isn't information transfer, in and of itself, a type of flux, that would limit the ways in which an observer can make accurate and precise observations about the world in and around us?   

I was inspired to think about the above types of things, while relaxing and watching this wonderful discussion about the topic of "infinity" - [*Mathematician Explains Infinity in 5 Levels of Difficulty, WIRED, YouTube, 30-01-2023.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp570S6Plt8)

Here are some other ideas along similar lines of discussion, that I end up pondering about, from time to time...

Suppose, we were to change the name of "axiom of choice, i.e. the 'choosing' function", in axiomatic set theory, to the "axiom of 'partitionability', i.e. the 'else' function."

The choosing function asserts the ability of a mathematician, to consciously choose what is or isn't included within a set, in order to be able to form a well defined set. The epistemological process of doing so, is encapsulated within a finite process or a mathematical function, called the choosing function. 

Is the choosing function, ontic? Asserting that it is ontic, allows for a certain type of a universe to be constructed, and then be made available to a mathematician's imagination; and not doing so, causes a slightly different type of a universe to come into existence for the mathematician. In both cases, one usually skirts the definition of the concept of "human consciousness", to avoid philosophical discussions on "theories of mind." 

However, if we were to suggest that "else" is an ontic process or a function, that essentially exists in the physical universe, due to which, for example, certain [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality) enantiomers of a compound don't manage to stay in a stable configuration; and also due to the else operation, certain orbits among planets orbiting a star as well as certain orbitals within atoms, cannot come into existence, then, we could explain why a particular else operation with its physical filtering mechanisms, is simply not contingent on human cognitive abilities, but is truly essential to the universe. In fact, we would also be able to better explain why human faculties including conscience, are contingent upon those foundational and ontic processes, such as, "physically existent else operations." 

Thereafter, we could explain that a particular type of a set, of physical things, naturally comes into existence, within the ontic universe along with its representation in the epistemic worldview of a human observer, only due to its corresponding else operation succeeding as a "functor." Consequently, when an else operation fails, its resultant set does not come into existence. Observers would most often only be able to appreciate else operations that succeed in producing a set, but let us try to imagine one that would fail, along with a discussion on what it means for an else operation to fail at constructing a set. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If any mathematician were to define the different types of physically evident else operations that can construct a corresponding set, they would recognize that an else operation is in itself, merely, a function within the observable universe; and constructing a physically tangible function that produces, or outputs all conceivable functions including itself, fails, as it hasn't been properly defined in a semantically coherent way. This is because, the function that produces all input as well as output conditions, including the ones that happen to generate itself, would also need to include all such "else operations", that would have to fail at segregating all partitionable typologies into: *included as well as excluded regions of the available input space, to form a bounded set, as an observable output.*[^1] 

Therefore, the notion of the largest unbounded collection of all possible things, that includes all existing and yet to exist collections, is supposedly the whole universe integrated over the entirety of time, throughout the ages (past, present, and future), along each principle axis of the physical universe. An unbounded collection, is clearly not a bounded set. Especially the unbounded collection of all conceivable and inconceivable things, does not allow for itself to become conveniently and unconditionally bounded, by an axiom of choice or an else operation, that it happens to already contain. 

Of course, both of the seemingly irreconcilable notions, wherein one implies that an unbounded collection of all things can be cast into a bounded set via an axiom of choice, and the other which implies that an unbounded collection of all things cannot be cast into a bounded set by any means what-so-ever, are neatly contained within the collection of all things. 

Moreover, at the current stage of humanity's anthropological development, we haven't yet decided as a global community of explorers and scholars, on how many minimum principle axes of spacetime are needed to unambiguously describe the observable phenomena listed within school text books. Is it 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, or 22 whole number dimensions; or is it genuinely, infinitely many, real-numbered dimensions of a fractal spacetime that collectively describe the universe within which, all reconcilable as well as irreconcilable things happen to exit? 

At times, musing about these kinds of unfathomable things, turns out to become a futile endeavor that various human beings, including myself, indulge in, as an escape from the mundane or prickly aspects of daily life. But, the mathematics which can be developed and expounded, in trying to address seemingly unsolvable questions, eventually becomes useful in exploring and solving various other kinds of mathematical problems and physical challenges that are of a practical and commercial nature. 

Likewise, in geo-politics, when one considers the physically finite, macro-level problems within the planet Earth, like that of the current war between Israel and Palestine, its challenging magnitude and complexity, somehow seem to be even more unsolvable and unending, compared to paradoxical theorems and lemmas articulated within publications of pure mathematics, and theoretical physics. But, the policies and exercises developed while attempting to resolve conflicts that Israel keeps getting embroiled in with its neighbors, will undoubtedly produce useful and worthwhile cultural outcomes as well as learning lessons, for citizens and residents of all countries in each part of the world. 

So, perhaps, and rather optimistically, in trying to redress issues of peace and sustainable living within the Middle-East, human beings might be able to better understand and solve numerous concomitant issues impacting global humanity as a whole. It would of course be quite the tragic letdown and a failure for all nations, to exacerbate the suffering of victims and survivors within various parts of the Earth, by allowing world leaders to spread hatred or killings, as opposed to having them sincerely commit to an immediate ceasefire; followed by having them enact procedures to appropriately furnish all injured or displaced individuals, with proper remedies and reparations. Who is to pay for those remedies and reparations? Those who were about to spend resources on weapons systems to cause more death and destruction can most certainly reallocate those funds towards peaceful reconciliations.

[^1]: If this type of a sentence makes no sense, just put it aside. It was supposed to highlight the paradoxical issue with trying to include non-observable or non-existent functions, as well as yet to exist functions, within the set of all observable and existent functions. Such puzzles might only be intriguing and interesting to mathematicians who want to explore the furthest reaches of "philosophy of mathematics."

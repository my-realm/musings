### What Counts as Treason 

If a distiller and a distributor of alcohol were to knowingly provide products such as wines and spirits containing 16 parts per million (PPM) of methanol, to Indian Military Canteens, while providing the same brands of alcohol to private establishments such as hotels and bars, with 3 or 4 PPM of methanol, wouldn't that be considered as an act of treason? 

3 to 4 PPM of methanol already exists in almost all consumable beers, wines, and spirits because of the manufacturing and storage process employed in selling those products to "Consumers." Some distillers claim that their triple distilled ethanol (vodka or dry gin) sold for human consumption, contains exactly zero PPM of methanol.   

Now, 16 PPM of methanol in a consumable product wouldn't exactly be lethal, at least, not to more than 50% of the targeted population exposed to that dosage. Those people would however, suffer a variety of impairments and injuries, and the crime would easily go unnoticed or undetected, for months or possibly years.   

Upon being discovered, the perpetrator could pretentiously say that it was entirely "unintentional" and would then be merely given a punitive fine of a few thousand Rupees, in a forum presided by a judge from the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Much more typically, the perpetrator would get away with committing such a dastardly act, upon being indicted, by invoking corporate indemnities and claiming that as the manager or proprietor of the commercial enterprise, he was "unaware" that some worker in his company was selling batches of contaminated or adulterated whiskey to soldiers. The perpetrator would then escape and be free to commit the same crime, with impunity. 

Targeting and deliberately harming the members of the Central Government of India, is an act of treason. Such traitors need to be brought to justice, especially when they are medical doctors or hospital managers who have a fiduciary duty to prioritize public safety above their corporation's pecuniary interests.

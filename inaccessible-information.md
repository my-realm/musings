## Inaccessible Information

Information cannot be destroyed in the sense that energy as well as mass cannot be destroyed simultaneously. 

However, information can become inaccessible, when energy transforms into mass, or when mass transforms into energy. During such transformations, information's quality can become altered to such an extent that, it can become unavailable within a region of spacetime, in a required magnitude of flux or momentum, the way it used to be. 

By the way, energy or momentum transfer between observable regions of spacetime are merely the evidence of information transfer across those regions. 

Now, what if, mass as well as energy could be simultaneously converted into a third thing that hasn't been properly identified, or has yet to be recognized by physicists? The appearance of an amount of energy and mass, simultaneously converting into a third thing within the multitudinous physical dimensions of spacetime, would make it seem as though, that amount of mass and energy was "destroyed", or "annihilated." Furthermore, if any amount of mass and energy were to be simultaneously converting into a third thing, within a physical dimension of spacetime that is conceivably higher in number, than the 4 or 5 dimensions we are accustomed to, then, most probably, we wouldn't be too concerned about it in ordinary life, unless we were somehow occupied as mathematicians, or theoretical physicists. 

So, would it be too erroneous by some convention or a standard, to posit the idea of "soul" or "psyche" as a third or a fourth kind of a thing, that is neither substance nor energy? Would it similarly be too absurd to posit that such a thing that is neither of physical energy or mass, happens to exist, on "a higher dimensional structure" of the universe that is beyond the grasp of our rudimentary cognition and current linguistic conventions? Is it entirely infeasible and impossible, for a thing existent in higher dimensions of spacetime, that is not constituted by energy and substance, to otherwise, be able to somehow interact with things within the seemingly ordinary 4 or 5 dimensions of physical spacetime we are accustomed to, in daily life? Those other dimensions could be fractional, or greater than the integer numbers commonly suggested in popular science. Those dimensions might even be expressed in terms of square-roots of minus-one, if one were to consider the "fractal" nature of the universe.

## A Vote of No Confidence Against The Incumbent Canadian Government

Consider this as an example: Has it ever mattered to you that the Sumerian civilization doesn't exist anymore, that there is no such thing as a city of Ur, where people currently live and exist as a society? It might be easy to rationalize that any civilization which disintegrates, breaks apart into pieces which, eventually get absorbed into some other civilization. Those pieces then invariably become a constituent part of other societal structures that continue to support humanity on this planet. It can thus be said that all is not lost, when a genocide sweeps through a terrain and culls its inhabitants, because some or the other survivors will end up as refugees in some or the other part of the world. But having been torn from their homeland, with shredded pieces of their past still attached to them, those survivors might only be able to straggle around in quiet suffering. 

In their new place of living, with bare minimum subsistence, some of the "local people" will undoubtedly suggest to them, the idea of going to a "therapist", so that the tattered remnants of the past, stuck to their outlook or behavior from having been forcibly ripped away from their home, can be neatly and fashionably covered up, or tailored into a more "presentable" form. The convenient labels of "trauma" or "traumatic experience", can then be tacked onto parts of the person's life by an industry that pretends to provide genuine healthcare, much like stickers that cover up a patch of a torn jacket. The quilted design of the person's life-story can then be paraded for others to consume via songs, photo albums, posters, comics, books, journals, magazines, paintings, artifacts, TV series, movies, or theater and stage performances. The suffering person and their tattered life will, as expected, get gobbled up by yet another avaricious part of a "victorious" civilization, that had orchestrated the destruction of the person's home in the first place. 

Indeed, there will always be a relativistic scale of timeline, or an allegorical sense of portraying a person's loss and heartache, so that the scale of time and the extent of loss can be conveniently positioned within a forced perspective, wherein the hurt and pain is "reasonably justified." 

>**As such, would it ever matter on the scale of two or three hundred years into the future from now, and in comparison to all the lives that will come to be born and then die during that time, throughout the planet Earth, if the version of Canada you have come to know, were to simply go out of existence? Is the version of Canada that exists right now, actually worth saving and retaining as a model of a legitimate, modest, non-polluting, and just society, into the coming millennia?** 

Within the timescale of centuries, and in an anthropological reference frame of humanity's planetary size, practically each and every existing country is likely to become considerably different than what it is right now, in the coming century. In fact, they might become so drastically different, that their legislated constitutions, borders, national anthems, flags, and cultural make, would turn out to be only reminiscent of what is, and has been, perceptible to the human eye, in merely subtle and nominal ways. For instance, currently existent countries are only reminiscent of what used to be in that region of Earth, two or three thousand years ago. More importantly, merely six centuries ago, all of the existing countries of the world along with their territories, didn't have their current names and geo-political boundaries.   

So, I hereby cast my <ins>Vote of No Confidence in Canada</ins> and in its currently constituted institutions, as they are downright bankrupt. Bailing them out will only be possible for a country like UAE or Saudi Arabia, to pay up in cash for Canada's ballooning international debts.[^1] And then, upon doing so, the new creditors and underwriters of Canada are likely to want to indicate to the world, the solemn yet fun fact that: 

>Canada had to be taken into receivership and refurbished, by bringing it into the control of *"Newer, New Management."* 

The necessary changes, that would rectify the failures of the erstwhile policies implemented in Canada by Dutch, German, French, British, and American institutions, might then be reflected by a flag, using a design along the lines of:

[^1]: At this very moment, a number of groups of people in the UK, the US, and especially in Canada, would have positioned themselves on a highchair, to then say that they can't and won't taking down my mixed-media artwork and modes of self-expression, from any social media, because supposedly, they are the ones who have granted me the right to "Freedom of Expression". And in having 'graciously' given me a right to express myself freely, they will claim to have paid their debt to me, and will not otherwise, make any public apologies and pay the actual remedies as well as punitive damages they still owe me and to thousands of persons like myself. That is how, those unrepentant wrongdoers from their highchairs will continue to arrogantly, conceitedly, condescendingly, and patronizingly add insult to injury, only to make it legal for me and persons like myself, to exercise every measure of lawful force necessary, to obtain due satisfaction and justice.

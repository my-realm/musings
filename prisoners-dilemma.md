## Quantum Mechanics Version of Prisoners' Dilemma

By the time someone reaches graduate school while studying any mathematics or science oriented subjects, they are likely to come across the topic of [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#Definitions) for the Prisoner's Dilemma. 


The premise of the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#Premise) goes somewhat like this:

- Two individuals assumed as belonging to an organization are caught by a policing agency when those individuals were observed as trespassing some kind of a restricted area. 

- Each of the apprehended individuals is labeled as a villainous operative, and is then held as a prisoner, in separate prison cells. 

- It is further assumed that prior to being caught, each of the prisoners were a closely related collaborator, with one another, or with other known felons. 

- Creating a rift between them would be the only way for the policing agency to weaken their bond of friendship or camaraderie, in order to further interrogate them about their organization, and about their motives in entering the restricted or forbidden area. 

- The policing agency is convinced that the two have intentionally committed a violation in a coordinated manner, by breaching security measures, though the policing agents, don't have sufficient evidence to prove their assumptions in a judicial courtroom. 

- Additionally, the police are not willing to accept either of the prisoners' claims about being a victim of a misunderstanding, or that their presence in the restricted area was somehow accidental or unintentional. 

- So, in order to interrogate them, each of the prisoners is left to squirm within an isolated prison cell, for an extended period of time. And when the police are convinced that the prisoners are desperate enough to betray each other, each is given the following offer without being allowed to communicate with one another through any means: 

    - To be able to gain a plea bargain, confess that the other prisoner was the master-mind who had nefarious intentions with a deliberate plan to commit a violation. 
	
	- Explain the entire premeditated plan, its end-goal, as well as all possible details of their organization in the form of a testimony; and accept being guilty of committing the crimes tabled in the charge-sheet. 
	
	- Upon doing so, the one who confesses first, will be guaranteed to get a lighter sentencing. Each prisoner is also told that if both confess at the same time, they will be given a more stringent punishment with a greater sentencing. And, if only either of them confesses, and the other one does not, then the individual who does confess to the crimes in the required format, may be pardoned entirely and set free, though it is not guaranteed. But, the one who absolutely does not confess, will be given the maximum punishment according to the existing statutory norms. If both do not confess to anything, they will be given the usual punishment, which is anyways, considerably harsh. 

    - A while later, each of the prisoner is told that the other has given a full confession and will be let out soon. Each prisoner is made to feel that they have been betrayed by the other. And then the police wait to see what happens next. 
	
To make the above example more concrete, let us imagine that both individuals were a celebrated Olympic athlete in swimming. Both were visiting an island as a tourist, and while they were taking pictures and selfies at a scenic location, they were apprehended by the police. Their phones and cameras were confiscated. Each of the imprisoned girls were then shown that within the background imagery of their selfies and other photographs, were a number of built-up structures, which belonged to a secret military base on the Greek island. That is why they were arrested, charged with espionage, and then imprisoned. 

You might say that the above information suddenly became a little too, oddly specific. Well, that is because it alludes to this incident - [Greek court drops farcical charges against rescue activists.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/13/greek-court-drops-spying-charges-against-activist-migrant-rescue-team) In the given link, the actual case is about refugees from Syria, being rescued by the 27 years old athletic swimmer, Sarah Mardini and her younger sister Yusra in 2015, after they rescued 18 refugees from a small boat that had capsized in the Aegean Sea. Those refugees ended up on a Greek island upon being rescued, and they along with their volunteering rescuers, weren't tourists; they weren't taking pictures of any kind of a secret base; and they didn't even have proper equipment or resources for their rescue efforts. Members from that stranded group of 24 persons including international rescue volunteers and refugees, are still in jail in Greece, awaiting trial since 2018, for a range of made up felony charges. Haven't they been punished enough? Do they genuinely deserve to be treated in that kind of a cruel and cynical manner by European and Greek officials, merely because they are non-Europeans seeking humanitarian aid and refuge, from war-torn regions of Syria and North-Eastern Africa? 

Regardless of the mathematical and game theoretic view that academicians may hold within their abstract thought-experiments, the reality of situations involving illegitimately detained persons, happens to be as such: 

>When innocent people are held in captivity for made up charges, any kind of a plea deal for a confession is unjust and is a disservice to those people. Use of corporeal punishments, torment, and torture, to break down human beings, in order for the broken individuals to seek respite from their suffering and from being violated, by submitting to a false confession, is far from any type of a just behavior that a regularized public service unit ought to ever commit.  

So, now, let's get back to the mathematics of the prisoner's dilemma, which we can extend to include more than two prisoners, and call it prisoners' dilemma. Also, let's dive into a much deeper thought-experiment, and imagine that the prisoners are Indians from India, in order to comprehend the quantum mechanics version of the prisoners' dilemma. 

- We can thus imagine, that the captors, keep asking questions to the prisoners during "enhanced interrogations", and the prisoners simply do ["the Indian head-bobble",](https://youtu.be/EoJ4Bvsq7gQ) as a response. 

In the classical prisoners' dilemma, only binary forms of outcomes are assumed, where each prisoner either does, or does not cooperate with the captors, in order to either 'collude with', or 'betray' the other prisoners. Malfeasance and wrongdoing on part of the prisoners, is already presumed. But, the Indian head-bobble, changes the situation to a much more multifaceted outcome, which does not involve a simplistic, mutually-exclusive, binary response from the prisoners. 

Additionally, in the classical example, the captors hold the expectation that at least one broken down prisoner can be seduced or deceived into betraying the others. The captors also maintain a strong conviction that, "a *'rational'* individual would maximize their *'self-interest'* to avert loss, pain, humiliation, and cruelty, by acting as selfishly as possible." 

However, a competent and impartial judge who is morally and ethically conscientious, ought to be aware that, the rationality of an individual being incarcerated, is only exhibited to an external observer, in the manner that the external observer wants to perceive, based on the detainee's outwardly behaviors to being 'probed and prodded.' Upon being questioned, any person would obviously try to maintain their innocence and that of their companions, and at times, also of mere acquaintances, due to an intrinsic sense of responsibility for care and consideration, towards themselves. 

Lack of knowledge about the motives and actions of fellow individuals, is also a reason to make a judgment call, that the likelihood of those fellows being not-at-all-guilty in a situation, is as likely as them being guilty of any charges being made against them, but affording them the benefit of uncertainty, and not stymieing or stigmatizing them by casting aspersions or doubts upon their character and personality, is simply the more humane and considerate thing to do. 

The burden of proof, or the need to obtain any evidence about the motives and activities of a group of detainees who were initially apprehended using "probable cause", obviously isn't to be shoved onto some selectively targeted individual or a sub-group among the detainees. None-the-less, that burden is too often thrust upon the detainees via unfair interrogation techniques and investigative practices involving entrapment, and-or normalized practices that deny the detained individuals access to competent and effective legal counsel in a language comprehensible to them. The much worse practice, adopted by corrupt public service agencies in various countries, is to not even explain the charges for being arrested, and to not show the warrant to the person during their arrest, by violating the person's basic human right to vital information in a situation where: their health, socio-economic status, as well as legal and political status, were about to be involuntarily altered by oath-bound public service agencies and groups. Those public agencies and groups, by the way, were supposed to remain dutiful because they are funded by tax-payer monies. 

Having elaborated on various challenges that make real-life situations far more complex than hypothesized academic models and scenarios, let us continue this socio-political discussion, by looking at few more issues, that make the prisoners' dilemma: [*indeterministic.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism#Quantum_mechanics) We shall of course do so, by using hypothesized models and scenarios, because, while all models are inaccurate with respect to experiential life, some are useful in communicating ideas and technical concepts. 

Consider a situation in which, the prisoners are indeed culpable in an act of organized crime, and one of the prisoner's is simply a ["fall-guy."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_guy) So, the fall-guy accepts all of the blame via a testimonial confession, and the other detainees simply corroborate, by blaming the designated scapegoat, due to a pre-arranged agreement about adopting such a strategy, if they were to get arrested. In this case, all of the culprits would be acting in a "rational" manner, because it is not at all irrational for a vulnerable and susceptible person to have been targeted, and then threatened or cajoled into becoming the group's scapegoat. 

Then consider another scenario wherein, innocent detainees simply chant a phrase or a scriptural verse due to their cultural upbringing, to overcome the fear they are subjected to by their captors. There are even cases when people become entirely quiet or seemingly catatonic, or alternatively, start talking incessantly about other arbitrary things not related to the questions being asked to them, because their emotional capacity to cope with their situation is so inadequate, that they end up exhibiting those kinds of behaviors. During such instances, gas-lighting the detainees to extract a confession under duress, and to falsely criminalize or pathologize their apparent behaviors, is hurtful, wrongful, and unjust. 

In the above types of cases, and in many other ones in which, a detainee simply walks out of an unlocked detention center and disappears due to the carelessness of the facility's officers and staff, can produce an eventual result, that is entirely outside the bounds of models used for explaining Nash Equilibrium. In real life, expecting a legally and politically dicey situation involving multi-ethnic and multi-national groups of people, to have a physical, deterministic Nash Equilibrium, by carelessly assuming that the expected equilibrium point's preconditions are satisfied, is moronic. But who can ever manage to explain this to indoctrinated policy makers who seek pop-science tidbits as a basis for justifying their policy decisions? Perhaps nobody or no one can. 

Such blog articles have been, and are being posted online regularly. They were, and are being sent to various public-facing inboxes of individuals or offices, via email, post, or a social-media platform such as Twitter (X), some of those recipients could become slightly irritated, for having their 'time wasted', by having read 'some meaningless and nonsensical, jargon filled tirades.' Many of those recipients might even use an excuse, to overlook or brush aside such materials, by convincing themselves that these articles were published and sent to them, in an utterly unorthodox fashion, through irregular channels, and worst of all, with content and stylization that has a bluntly irreverent tone with hard to understand language. 

I would like to apologize to those people who were expecting a watered down, and obsequies form of communication that would otherwise alert them to ongoing instances of systematic and bigoted forms of violations against vulnerable people; unabated violations that include molestation, harassment, thefts, abductions, serial murders, mass murders, and genocidal activities, all of which have continued to happen under their watch, in plain view of the public. They would not have become alerted to act in a forthright manner, because they quite simply haven't, in the past three years by my letters and emails, nor have they in the past decades, by the outcries of thousands of other people each year, via their direct, in-person meetings as well as through their plight discussed in newspapers, research journals, websites, TV series, movies, conferences, and even in official reports published every other year, by other government-authorized committees. 

My approach towards obtaining some measure of worthwhile justice, for a range of violations and offenses committed against people like myself, as documented in these types of articles, has been simple: 

- Make sure that the language and length of the content in these articles causes grunt workers called in to read and summarize such materials, to give up, and to then, handover these sets of things in their original format, to their supervisors. Eventually, some of this will reach a stickler for the truth, who is competent enough to at least go through the abstract and the introduction of the sets of material published with a table-of-content. The sets that do not have a book like format, are certainly more difficult to navigate, as their content is only for addressing incidental issues that have come up during the course of this overall endeavor. 

- Add sufficiently many keywords in each article so that it can be picked up by search engine bots and crawlers. This means that, sometimes popular topics like "quantum mechanics" have to be connected to the main subject matter, in an artistic way, using  extended analogies. 

    - Do I know anything useful in search engine optimization techniques? Try copy-pasting or typing the following text, including the quotation marks, into a search engine like Google, DuckDuckGo, or... Bing. 

        >"Do Canadian lives matter?" 

- Use a URL for these files with a human-readable structure, so that at least I can remember or search for particular topics published in different sets of articles. 

- Wait a few months or a few years, for some of the recipients to realize that I am not a punk or a jester who is simply spamming or trolling them with tomes of window-dressing for pointless word-salad. I am definitely not a scammer, becuase scammers don't simultaneously ring up the departments of justice, the state, and of defense, unless they are: *the* Donald Trump. 

    - I am certain that at least 1 out of 30 of the people who may have chanced upon any of this, and who happen to possess the acumen of at least, a business analyst, will figure out which parts of these digital artifacts with mixed-media content, can be used for advancing their own objectives. Of course, this might end up in the hands of people who are far more skilled and resourceful than 'business' analysts. However, it is more likely that 1 out of 300 people might do something consequential for social-justice, among those who have bothered to click on a link to this material, that they somehow received or obtained.

- Take advantage of the fact that one group of people in Ontario, Canada, who murderously violated my personhood, assassinated my character, repressed me out of religious discrimination, caused the death of my child, and repeatedly defiled my home, were careless enough to give someone with my kind of work-experience and knowledge, the cover of pleading 'bouts of insanity', should the need ever arise. 

    - Of course, different bureaucratic agencies across various countries might end up disproving the possibility of me not having any type of a mental ailment or a disability, and then block that option, if they were to compare their notes and surveillance data. But why and how would the ones in different continents of the Earth, ever cooperate for comparing their notes, on any subject matter, let alone for discerning and authenticating the identity of a harmless person like me?    

So what exactly is it that I used to do, and why do I have detailed knowledge about certain category of topics, that most other people, simply wouldn't care to learn about? 

Well, if you are genuinely interested, start [here][1], and then follow your own adventure while navigating through various and several pieces of digital artifacts and literature, published online by me.

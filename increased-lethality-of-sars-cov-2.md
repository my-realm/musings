## Increased lethality of SARS-CoV-2

Imagine if a variant of [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2) were to grow new types of motile and primary structures on its viral envelope, similar to a [cilium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium) or a [flagellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum), adjacent to its existing spike glycoprotein. Would that increase its infectiousness? Perhaps it could, by allowing the virus to sense its environment in a better way, so that it can distinguish between a live epithelial cell with the appropriate binding receptor, and a dead or a dummy binding receptor introduced into a human body from a vaccine.

But a virus is not a bacteria or an eukaryotic cell, so why would the nCoV grow new types of cilia or flagella adjacent to its glycoprotein structures? 

Umm... because it can... and because it can be made to via genetic recombination. 

So it is possible that the variants of SARS can become extra lethal and more infectious, by the year 2027? Yep.

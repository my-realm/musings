## Democratic Newsroom

Try this decision making system for your newsroom: 

- Provide 100 units of currency for each weekly news cycle, to each team member, which they can take as a bonus at the end of the week, or invest any portion of it, into a piece of contested news item they believe in, to boost that item's visibility. 

- If somebody else wants to downplay a particular news item, then they will need to invest more than the amount apportioned to it, by its supporters within your newsroom. 

- This is how all of your team members can put their money where their heart is, including you. The 100 tokens can represent an actual monetary sum, such as the weekly amount of the statistically normalized value of all members' monthly salary, including yours. 

So, eventually the chips can be allowed to fall wherever they may. 

The above system can obviously, also be implemented within a boardroom, or a war room. This is because it is based on one of the reasons, due to which, individuals within organizations like [teachers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachers_Without_Borders) [lawyers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyers_Without_Borders) [engineers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Without_Borders) [doctors,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res) and [reporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders) without borders, tend to invest their personal effort and time into projects they believe in. Many people tend to voluntarily invest their personal life, skills, and resources, towards a worthy cause that they would like to support, because they intend to see it through to its logical conclusion, without it being shot down by high-margin based corporate interests. 

So, in various cooperative and not-for-profit[^1] organizations, which can also be multi-national corporate entities, the fact that we exist within a world where market forces and geopolitical power-dynamics already play a significant role in every human being's daily life, is recognized and reconciled via consensus driven efforts that acknowledge each member of the organization, at a common platform, during crucial instances of organizational decision making. 

This is how, apart from hard and soft power, there happens to exist, the [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) power of global-scale, crowd-sourced efforts of named as well as anonymized people, facilitated by internet and artificial intelligence based technologies. 

[^1]: By the way, a not-for-profit entity does not imply that it is a non-revenue-generating entity. A non-profit organization may generate billions of Euros in annual revenues, and happen to break-even, after covering all of its fiscal year's expenses. The retained earnings of those types of non-profit organizations, may end up in a charitable trust fund, due to standard accounting practices.

## My Writing and Publishing Process

We must first start with the assumption that a number of intelligence and security agencies are conducting constant, high-intensity level of surveillance, over all of my on-ground and online activities. The pertinent question isn't why they would bother to do something like that, the only worthwhile question is, "Why would they not be keeping tabs on a person who nudges them via Twitter, at least once every week?" 

I haven't yet gotten to the stage of pinging them daily via automated Tweets. Doing that, would most probably be considered as spamming them, which, I don't need to do. 

So, the maximum extent of surveillance that an agency from India, China, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Germany, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Israel, the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, or from any other region might be able to do, would be to monitor my activities in real-time. 

Let's say that at least a few state-sponsored agencies and a variety of other non-state actors in the world, are currently capable of viewing the keystrokes and screen of a target computer, such as mine, in real-time; and are capable of reading this text, as well as any other file in my computer network, as and when it gets created or edited by me. 

Let's call them Alphas. So, the Alphas conveniently have a "first mover advantage", over any other state-sponsored groups or non-state actors, all of whom may go through the contents of the files being published by me on GitHub and Twitter, after I upload them online. Let's call these groups that gain information from my activities, only after I publish some content online, as the Betas. 

However, I tend to edit and revise the "artistic" content I create, after it is initially published online, from time to time. So, maybe, simply waiting for a day or two before viewing my online self-published content, could be beneficial for obtaining more accurate and clear pieces of knowledge, from those files. 

Of course, there are many private articles and research notes on various topics that I have written, and keep writing, which are yet to be published. Those articles and notes are merely sitting in my computer, and maybe, just maybe, the Alphas could have got their hands on those files. Does that matter to anyone, is it significant or important in any respect? Who knows? ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ 

In any case, I can only assume, that the decisions or judgments taken by any group that has advanced monitoring and surveillance capabilities, is hopefully, not wasting their resources and efforts in vein, by using tax-payer monies for conducting real-time surveillance on little ol' me. 

Let us try to picture or tabulate, what that decision process for an intelligence company or bureau, might look like: 

- A decision matrix for evaluating whether some type of an activity done by a person or a group of people, is a threat of some sort to someone or not, requires the decision maker to create a predictive model, with a wide variety of parameters. Each of the intelligence agencies in the world, along with their think-tanks and contracted teams, have their own sets of proprietary "models", for conducting threat assessments. 

  - A model's predicted outcome might be objectively or subjectively rated by the model's developers as: True, or False. 

  - And the eventual outcome from a situation, in actuality, can be subjectively regarded by decision makers as being: Positive, or Negative with respect to their personal interests. 

  Prediction vs Actuality | Prediction True | Prediction False
     --- | --- | ---
     **Actuality Positive** | True-Positive | False-Positive
     **Actuality Negative** | True-Negative | False-Negative

  **Table 1:** Generic decision matrix for evaluating an outcome

But regardless of what the predicted output from a statistical or a simulation based model turns out to be, on a daily or even a minute-by-minute basis, there remains a gap between taking a model's output, and then actually doing something tangible (concrete) based on it. A decision to withhold a certain type of action, is of course, an action in itself. 

So, let us try to make the above set of ideas, more palpable, by going through a hypothetical scenario. 

Suppose, an intelligence or a law enforcement agency, becomes 'curious' about my activities, and intends to evaluate whether the materials being published online by me are "seditious" in some way, or inciting the audience towards violence, or "regicidal", or somehow fraudulent or objectionable. Thereby, an agent or a team gets assigned, and that agent or the team of analysts get to work, by looking into the content of such files, using their tools and techniques. 

The first thing they might find, is that the overall content is rather voluminous, and that various files are encrypted. So then they try to use some "heuristics", to come up with an actionable decision, based on a small sample of files from my GitHub repositories. Perhaps, they end up spending some effort in decryption the locked files, and find that the content in those files, is basically similar to the open sourced materials, except, with few details that might cause a national security analyst, to get slightly worked up. 

Eventually, after going through some more files, they are likely to find that some of text contains phrases in different languages, perhaps, merely as an oddity, or as an actual "coded message" to somebody from me. 

Some of them might get vexed because of the daunting size of their task, and decide that all of this is pointless or "spurious", and that I must be a mentally ill or a lame person, so they may give up. They may claim that their work here is completed, having labeled me, the author of such material, as simply weird or deranged. Of course, other teams of Alphas and Betas from other agencies, might not tier or give up so easily, as they wouldn't be satisfied with a simplistic reason for being dismissive of such content. Especially the Alphas may realize that, some of the files and text that only they are able to access, contain detailed materials about nuclear defense technologies and weaponry. They may also realize that there isn't anything that is actually stopping me from publishing those things online. But, then, they might wonder, "What would be the big deal if I were to open source all those yet to be published files." 

Arriving at a consensus about what any of this is actually worth to an intelligence agency or to a layperson, among the members of a team, may be achievable, mainly because one or the other influential member often makes a hard judgment call on behalf of their investigative team, to make things move along. However, it is highly unlikely that different teams, especially ones from different countries, would somehow arrive at the same conclusion from their separate investigations and analyses, because all of them have inherently different motivations, perspectives, biases, assumptions, and methodologies, in conducting their respective surveillance work; obviously! 

Imagine the situation of the poor agents keeping tabs on my activities, each of them wondering what they could have been doing in life, instead of the drudgery they have been assigned to. Or perhaps, some of them are absolutely duty-bound and "resolute", never wasting a moment or falling asleep on the job, constantly vigilant, and ever ready to outpace and outsmart, "the other camp." 

Maybe, by now, some of the Alphas and Betas could have figured out a way to collaborate to create the Sigma team; maybe. 

So, as the reader, whatever might be your assessment about my motivations, I can, simply tell you what my intentions and purposes are, in producing [such a vast array of content:](https://github.com/samkhan1) 

>I will make the pretentious cheats, the murderous goons, and the treacherous fiends who've hurt my family and diaspora, pay dearly. And I will stop those wrongdoers, for good, through your help and assistance.

By the way, one might also benefit from considering a decision matrix of "planned vs unplanned activities" producing outcomes that are "fruitful vs unfruitful."

## A Movie Review

There is something a little too poignant in the movie, "The American Society of Magical ~~Heroes~~ Negros", that white people, no matter how non-racist they may be, will simply not like, and will feel insulted or betrayed for being portrayed as oblivious, self-centered, racist Karens. And I should say, let those people feel that way, because that movie utilizes every scene, and every bit of "movie magic", to keep building on the point of needing to break free from having to walk on egg-shells around white-people. Of course, any single individual who stands up and raises their voice against repression, risks having their collective community brutally punished. So, upsetting or "displeasing" white people, somehow, still carries the real risk of people of color being lynched, as well as the risk of a country of ethnic people that white-supremacists find socioeconomically or politically "disconcerting", being destabilized and carpet bombed. 

Sadly, most of the movie's reviews have subversively marginalized the honest talent and satirical humor brought to cinema by its wonderfully creative team. Those negative reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes have done so, and continue to do so, by pretentiously saying that the movie could have been more hard hitting, on the topic of racism viewed from the perspective of people facing racial inequality and injustice, instead of using the sub-plot and a "toned down" narrative of a light-hearted romantic comedy, to showcase the daily struggles of people in America, particularly of Black people who are expected to "fit in" with White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant expectations, when it comes to social etiquette, patriotism, and decency.   

If the rich symbolism, historical references, and meaning of the word servicemen or sargent, available in each frame of the movie were to be highlighted one-by-one, to lay audience members, it still wouldn't make any sense, to viewers who have chosen to remain 'tone deaf' and 'color blind' to the plight of people in this world who happen to have colored skin or non-white heritage. 

Also, if one were to change the color space of the movie while watching it, to make it a bit more playful and surreal, the themes of the movie could shine through, in a much more magical way. My personal opinion of and rating for the movie, *"The American Society of Magical Negros",* is a must watch and a 7/10.

Lastly, as a slightly tangential side note, and as a gift to movie buffs, I'd like to mention and recommend the Indian movie, *"Chintu Ka Birthday."* It tells a placid story of a group of Indian expats in Iraq, who like the Iraqi, were and continue to be expected to put up and shut up, against every act of cruelty, torment, and oppression thrust upon them, while they are further expected to be "cheerfully humble, cooperative, and subservient" in every conceivable situation, by colonialists and supremacists.

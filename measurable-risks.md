## Measurable Risks

When risks are taken, the simplest question to be asked is, at whose expense were those risks being taken? Did the risks involve transgressions and violations committed against any person's rights, liberties, properties, or well being? 

When a group of people take "calculated risks" in the name of exploration, innovation, or business development, and cause another set of people to suffer ruinous and devastating losses, "the risk takers" thus commit a foul, by knowingly engaging in forceful, or cunning activities, leading to innocent bystanders or community stakeholders to become harmed or injured. Allowing such "risk takers" to constantly get away with the harms and damages generated by them to human ecology, and to other human beings, is an added violation and an offense committed by officers of the law, perpetrated against injured and suffering people who have yet to be properly compensated via genuine remedies and award of punitive damages.  

The most natural consequence of long-standing injustice is for wronged persons to "take the risk", of needing to employ "novel" measures and mechanisms, such as the ones being employed here via GitHub, for obtaining proper and satisfactory recompense in a timely manner. 

So, all you need to know is that, every defiled home, and desecrated life, will be avenged in due course of time, by a rightful blood-redeemer!

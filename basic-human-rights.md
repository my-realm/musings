## Basic Human Rights

Of the numerous rights that are acknowledged as necessary and fundamental to function as a decent human being in society,[^1] the topic of right to sexual and reproductive health is often overlooked. Indeed, such important topics are sidelined by so-called educated councilors, during legislation of laws and programs aimed at protecting denizens of their jurisdiction, from being harmed and injured by violators. 

Particularly when it comes to the legal definition of rape, the presence or absence of violence, need not be a sticking point. 

Sexual acts thrust upon an infirm, inchoate, disabled, vulnerable, or an incapacitated person is a violation of the person's right to forthright information and to be protected against bodily and psychological harms. Those sexual acts might not involve the use of force or violence, and may instead, involve the use of manipulation, duress, prodding, coercion, misdirection, sedatives, secrecy, and deception due to which, those acts are a violation and an abuse of the victim's basic human rights to physical well being, reproductive health, and personal safety. 

The EU recently failed to observe and to include such basic legal concepts in the definition of rape, for legislating a proper directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence.[^2] 

So, the solution for clashing EU legislators to resolve their differences in viewpoints about basic rights, might be to acknowledge different categories of sexual abuse and harassment against people of any gender or age, according to the level of violence or coercion used by a perpetrator in overriding the victim's freewill, in making the victim unwittingly or unwillingly participate in sexual activities, against the victim's proper knowledge and awareness. Similar categories can be defined for individuating types of harassment when a victim is subjugated to unwanted contact of any sexual nature, by an offender. 

Especially, when the victims are too young, too old, and otherwise impaired or vulnerable due to various factors, the concept of "consent" would obviously not be necessary in highlighting the nature of sexual violations or harassment committed against the victims. When the victims are unimpaired adults, it would logically be necessary to include the concepts of "consent" as well as "provable physiological and psychological capacity of the adult to provide appropriate consent", in topics concerning sexual or any other type of activities that can cause uninformed and vulnerable individuals to be thrust into a compromising situation with a potential to be exploited and harmed by predatory violators. 

In a more generalized sense, categorically identifying[^3] the level of violence or manipulation used by offenders in overriding a victim's rights, in causing the victim or other members of society to suffer harms or damages, can also be defined formally using standardized procedures. 

Now, why am I qualified to give any kind of an opinion on such matters? I am no one, and entities within organizations like the US government have continued to find cunning ways to abuse the labors and work outputs of people like me, in violation of our moral rights and freewill, to then allow their agencies with three or four letter acronyms, to circumvent local as well as international statutory laws and conventions.  

So, if you are asked, who pointed you towards such seemingly unsolicited views or opinions? You can say, "no one did." And that you found such articles on your own by checking your social media feed.

Such a meaning of categories and groups of entities is used here, along with the view that properties and relationships among "groups" that present themselves as either able-bodied, disabled, minors, adults, men, women, or trans-gendered persons, can be legally and objectively defined via [Group Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory#Combinatorial_and_geometric_group_theory) for the purposes of implementing unambiguous statutes and judiciary activities for, or upon, such groups.

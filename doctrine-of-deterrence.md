## Doctrine of Deterrence

In legal affairs, the "Principle of Least Punishment" does not prioritize nor explain the qualitative value of an eventual societal goal that is to be achieved, for which, a particular lawful action ought to be committed by the judiciary in a given case. It also does not explain the sense of "distance" or "path", that exists between the current state of not having achieved justice and fairness, and the future state of having achieved sustainable justice and equitable fairness in society due to judicial actions. 

In physics or natural philosophy, the concepts of "action" and "expenditure" are well defined, based on underlying physical concepts of distance, speed, and kinetic energy. And the "Principle of Least Action" is analytically formulated in physics to satisfy the conditions of an assumed, perfectly stationary or static end-state, involving a given system of physical objects. 

Now, it is a serious error, to misappropriate the idea of "least action" from the domain of physics into the domain of civics, as the idea of "least punishment." The complacency of an incompetent or a corrupted judge, cannot be hidden behind propped up justifications for issuing court orders within the assumed judicial limits and intents, so that the culpable agents or agencies be allowed to pay a tiny monetary sum as the least penalty or as a reprimand, without admission of guilt on part of the culpable parties. Those types of culprits and malicious actors consider such court ordered monetary fines, merely as "cost of doing business", only to then continue their organized crimes without any remorse or repentance. 

Therefore, the minimum output from the judiciary to lawfully curtail and rectify the identified organized crimes being committed by corporate or institutional wrongdoers, must prioritize the "Doctrine of Deterrence", to make sure that the punishment given to convicted criminals for organized crimes also discourages and prevents others from repeating those offences and violations. 

>**The harms and damages suffered by victims at the hands of mafia bosses running criminal syndicates, aren't due to "misfortune" of unforeseen and intractable events. Mafia bosses most certainly have knowledge of how to use managerial techniques and controls, to orchestrate serial crimes while taking undue advantages of cumulative errors committed by legislators, policing agencies, and judiciary officials. Such fecklessness and cowardice that is often observed within the shortcomings of poorly framed law enforcement directives, will only amount to a grave misfortune, for human society as a whole, if the activities of organized criminals and their syndicates are allowed to propagate, instead of being permanently curtailed and deterred.**

## No useful Steganography here... in this folder. 

These images don't even have their meta-data stripped, honestly, because I'm too poor and lazy to afford multiple hardware and vmtools to create images with [Steganographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#Digital_messages) messages in them. Plus, for whom would I bother to put in such efforts, while attempting to communicate a message to them? For you?

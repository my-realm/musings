## Electronic Method for Nailing Corrupt Judges 

<sub><b>| Date: 22-09-2025 | Place: Hyderabad, India |</b></sub>

The panel of Judges belonging to Ranga Reddy District's Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (CDRC) in L. B. Nagar Court Complex of Hyderabad, Telangana, have the following habit of extracting bribes from citizens seeking legal services from their office:

1. A bribe of approximately Rs. 1000/- given to the Assistant of the Office Superintendent, in the CDRC office, can ensure a calendared case number being assigned by the Office Superintendent, for a submitted Consumer Complaint with a serial number. The bribe can be given to that office clerk, after lunch hours, around 3 pm, in the Court Hall of the CDRC building, when it is empty and only the clerk awaits there to "interact personally" with those needing to have their cases numbered. One can also simply slip an amount to that clerk at his desk on the first floor of the CDRC building, while awaiting a serial number to be assigned to a submitted Consumer Complaint. 

1. An additional bribe of approximately Rs. 2500/- can ensure that the panel of Judges presiding over the calendared case can be more favorable towards the complainant. This bribe is also funneled via the staff of CDRC so as to create a veil or a buffer between the panel of Judges and the bribe giver, so as to shroud the act of bribing those Judges. 

<br> 

Each day, 15 to 20 such discrete acts of bribing occur in the CDRC at L. B. Nagar Court Complex. This amounts to approximately 40,000/- in collection as bribes, per day, and more than Rs. 5,00,000/- per month. 

Now, an agency such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the Crime Investigation Department (CID) can try to conduct a sting operation with marked bank notes, to trace the extent of corruption due to such bribes. However, the CDRC's clerk being the fall guy, wouldn't reveal the end-beneficiary of such bribes. The office clerks and peons, aren't personally devouring 5 Lakhs Rupees per month, as that money is simply getting routed up the pipeline, to their superior officers. 

And, the marked bank notes among the bribes given in cash, become untraceable, upon getting laundered via local temples and "monastic trusts." 

### Using Tracking Chips 

So, here is one more way of tracing the end-beneficiary of a bribe:

- Insert a GPS / GNSS module (or a 4G LTE or a BlueTooth module), into a gift-like physical artifact, an artifact such as a "Ganesha Statue." Suppose the artifact is small, about 20 cm cube in volume, and is made to appear expensive, by plating it with gold or a gold-like metal, and adorning it with precious looking gems. Give it some patina for "authenticity." If the object has a thick enough base, the electronics and the coin battery can be inserted conveniently into it. This could be something of the size and shape of the below image.

- Next, explain to the bribe-taking clerk that the "gift" is worth 25k INR or something similarly expensive, and also let them know that the Consumer Complaint is worth 200k INR (a decently large amount less than 500K INR). Then, hand the bribe to them. Oh! Of course, you do need to submit a set of documents that look like a Consumer Complaint along with that gift. Also, let them know that the gift is for the President of the CDRC tribunal, and that it has been "blessed." 

<br>

The bribe-taking clerk doesn't keep the bribe, he shuffles it off to a person outside the Court Complex who then takes it away. The GPS / GNSS / BlueTooth (wide area band) tracking, is for detecting the path and location of where that bribe finally ends up. Cash as well as physical objects as gifts and bribes, appear to be going to the same destination for appraisal and final re-distribution to the underlings within the corrupt network of particular Judges and their office staff.   

Eventually, when the final destination of the bribes and gifts are identified, one shouldn't be surprised to learn that it is a senior Judge's house, and that soon afterwards, that house burns down, while the fire department silently watches all of that unearned cash go up in smoke, instead of saving the so-called "blessed money."

<br> 

>**There is no God or Goddess in Hindu mythology who is a callous-blind-deaf-mute, like a lifeless piece of stone.**
> 
>**Which God or Goddess could possibly "bless" such corruption that involves temples and the endowments departments of various states which are being used as money laundering machines?**  

<br> 

This isn't a DIY project for Anyone or Everyone from no_one, it is merely a topic for investigative and law enforcement agencies to earnestly meditate upon. 

The fact that the integrity and character of identifiable public servants can be impugned using hard proofs and clear evidences, only goes to show that those dishonourable individuals were never ethical to begin with, and were never beyond reproach. Those unlawful wrongdoers as public servants, have continued to drag down the reputation and trustworthiness of important public institutions, with impunity, and without any personal consequences to themselves. 

The rest of the evidence of corruption in the district CDRC at L. B. Nagar Court Complex in Hyderabad, Telangana, is the conspicuous absence of the the new IT and video conferencing equipment along with the new furniture, that was supposed to have been purchased by the said district Consumer Forum using Central Government money disbursed to their office from the National Commission for CDRC.  

Unless those corrupt individuals in the district CDRC of Telangana are lawfully punished with swift and stringent policing action, the basis of our society will continue to become hollow, and it may ultimately become devoid of all virtuous values that are worthy of respect.

## Poorer Version of Fatalism  

A poor and and rather hopeless version of [fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism) (भाग्यवाद) has been festering within the mindset of many people I have met in India. In this poorer version of fatalism, the main belief is that every incident a person encounters in their current life, is brought about by only their own decisions and actions, from a previous life.  

From such a worldview, which thing was supposed to be the primordial life-form that made all the vital and original decisions to cause a person's life to exist in its current state? Ah yes, it was "god", wasn't it?  

To say that everything a person experiences in their current station in life, is strictly brought about by their own doing, and that they deserved to go through the things they have encountered, is considerably ignorant of the fact that infants and severely impaired persons are not legally capable of being responsible decision makers.  

Every adult human being who is currently alive, was once an infant. So, attributing issues like, rape of a minor, as something that the victim "deserved" because the child somehow brought it upon themselves, is a disgusting and a particularly annoying notion, from my perspective. 

Especially in a legal context, I personally do not believe that people born with mental and physical disabilities somehow brought it upon themselves due to their actions and deeds, from a "previous life." I also do not believe that it is just or right, to say that a vulnerable person who is sexually assaulted or murdered or physically abused in any manner, somehow deserved to be put through that type of harm. 

The blame, of cheating or injuring someone, is on the cheater and the injurer. 

Likewise, the responsibility of deterring crimes and prosecuting identified culprits, is on the duty-bound public prosecutors and government pleaders and magistrates hired by society, to properly get that job done.  

This is why, I find it very annoying when I repeatedly encounter various police officers and advocates, who thoughtlessly blame the victim, instead of doing their job of arresting and curtailing the crimes of already known and identified violators. Too many police officers I have met in India, don't even bother to take a victim's testimony seriously to start an investigation into the reported crime. 

For instance, did the victims in Pahalgam, Kashimir, in the recent terror attacks, deserve to be killed in the gun violence they suffered? Weren't those victims innocent? Did their family members deserve to be put through the horror and terror of being targeted? Did those victims, somehow, bring all of it upon themselves and the ensuing war upon the rest of the Asian subcontinent?   

This is why I wonder if it is supposed to be ironic that, my widowed elderly mother who had set the Hindi exam paper for the Indian Police Services (IPS) and the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) examinations, for particular sets between the years 2008 and 2011, could have selected the police officers who refused to come to her aid. My mother as a professor of Hindi and Sanskrit, had also invigilated and evaluated thousands of exam papers written in Hindi for IAS entrance tests, via the Indian Public Services Commission (IPSC), during those years. However, when a set of crimes committed by the local mafia was reported by me to the Telangana police, the police refused to record a First Information Report (FIR) against the accused individuals. Those particular police officers, might have been selected by my mother, or she might have inducted those individuals into the police force who betrayed us and our trust, by her own "deeds" due to her past decisions and actions.

The local police inspector and sub-inspector in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, told me that the type of crimes I had informed them about, had been occurring routinely within hospitals throughout the districts of Telangana for years, and that the accused mangers as well as complicit medical practitioners belonging to healthcare organizations, cannot be prosecuted by the police, simply because the police has not been able to collect sufficient physical evidence aside from the victim's statement, in each reported incident at hospitals or colleges, during the past several years. So, the local police has simply stopped recording and reporting any FIR against crimes involving abduction of vulnerable persons, economic offenses, sexual misconduct, or grievous injuries and hurt caused by medical practitioners or any other workers in the healthcare and education industry sectors of India.

>As such, how can any human individual, escape the fate or destiny of humanity?  

So, I suggest that, hundreds if not thousands of local police officers in Telangana can resign to their fate, of being killed or injured due to assailants launching bio-chemical and cyber-warfare attacks targeting police stations in various states of India. It is not like any unit in the whole of the Indian police forces and intelligence agencies, has ever been conducting regular practice drills to survive attacks involving things like Sarin gas or Novichok. 

Now, was I the one who was supposed to supply them gas masks and hazmat suits? I could have been the person making the supply-chain arrangements for such essential equipment and protective gear, but I have instead been busy doing basic policing work of investigating how organized crime has become rampant within Telangana. 

Why have I had to do such investigative work even though there isn't anyone paying me for it? Is it for public service? Or, for preserving basic human dignity? Or, for patriotism and familial love? 

So, I suppose, the local police can go figure out how to deal with chemical warfare and modern cyber-warfare, on their own. They may say that all this was fated, and that I was never going to be able to help them overcome their funding issues for industrial supply of proper equipment and training, especially at the time of war. And I will merely have to agree with them, won't I? 

Or, perhaps, I am not so easily dissuaded by few incompetent police officers and government bureaucrats, and have thus taken it upon myself, to get them fired. Particularly so that the rest of the IPS and IAS can function in a better way, and can get the appropriate tools and equipment they need for surviving that which is about to fall upon all of us. 

The concept of fatalism simply ignores the fact that, at any given time, there are many people in the world who are bound to be living with age related inabilities, or with particular mental and physical situations, because of which they simply cannot be legally held responsible for taking care of themselves, let alone for the occurrences of any social or economic phenomena in society. 

So, what should able-bodied and competent adults do? Should we simply abandon the roles and responsibilities that our individual and collective conscience has recognized, as our fitting and "chosen" pathway in life?

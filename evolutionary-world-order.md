## Evolutionary World Order

The proponents and promoters of "the International 'Rules' Based Order" still continue to assume and stipulate that:

1. A global jurisdiction of American, European, and British agencies exists within which, those agencies have supremacy, primacy, and ultimate authority over the institutions of all other nation states;

1. An ethnic ranking of nations and cultural groups of people throughout the world based on Anglo-Saxon racism exists, that is somehow ordained by a Christianized "God" and by "nature" within which, the whitest of whites, among different types of white people, is the ultimate and supreme group that gets to set the rules and conventions about what is supposed to be fair and legal across all domains and realms. (And never mind the non-whites, they are all "the lesser groups and peoples".)

The novel geopolitical changes emerging across the world have started with the dismantling of socio-economic and political structures that promote the above two stipulations of a bygone era's "World Order." That so-called World Order which had come into existence after World War II with America and Britain at its helm, is not worthy of respect anymore; and that bygone World Order's racist outlook or viewpoints do not need to be held or promoted by educated and well informed residents of the world. The removal of racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and other types of discriminatory prejudices from international organizations that had formed the basis of the previous world order, is now being labeled as signs of "fragmentation" and "chaos" within the modern world, by numerous Western analysts.  

Any nation that openly rejects subordination and servility to America and Britain, is seen as a threat by the promoters of the so-called "International 'Rules' Based Order" in which, the very first rule was, and still is: to willfully and cheerfully obey and submit to the supremacy and dominance of Christianized Anglo-Saxon cultural values, or else be branded as an enemy of "The Free and Civilized World." 

This is why, existent free and civilized nations of the world from regions of Central and South America, Africa, Eurasia, Asia, and Oceania, cannot submit to the racist views and demands of Anglo-Saxon hegemony, especially in an era where other than supplying warmongering and advanced weaponry, Anglo-Saxon countries have nothing specifically unique or crucial to supply to the rest of humanity. 

The evolving world order is neither fragmented nor chaotic, it is merely evolutionary.

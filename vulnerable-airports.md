## Vulnerable Airports

Before exploring vulnerabilities of existing airports and airliners, let's muse about the uniquely human chore of creating "defense systems" like ramparts and castles... 

For hundreds of years, human beings have been constructing defense systems with a multi-layered architecture. That is why, one basically needs to find and thread through the holes in each layer, to generate an "attack vector." 

These days, military grade AI models have become exceptionally good at threading the needle's eye, in each layer of any given defense system. And when I say any defense system, I do mean any, without any exaggeration.    

In my humble opinion, a large gaping hole exists within the defenses of countries with industrially developed and newly developing economies because of the possibility of incursions from unmanned vehicles, into secure locations within those countries. 

>When the human pilot (or driver) is removed from the vehicle, the vehicle can do much more risky and dangerous activities, especially if the vehicle doesn't have to be retrieved or reused. This is the basis of numerous, versatile, modern warfare tactics. 

In a generalized sense, a vehicle with its payload can be an aerial, terrestrial, aquatic, biochemical, electro-mechanical, or a cybernetic "thing." It can even be an outer-planetary object such as a space satellite. In each of these domains of activity, if the vehicle has some measure of autonomy, then it can accordingly become capable of doing a range of: unsupervised or remotely supervised actions. 

With advanced AI, a seemingly dumb thing can be effectively transformed from a vehicle into an "agent" with agency to perform specific activities, especially the types of activities that need sensory and cognitive capabilities. 

One can also observe that the computational capabilities of existing AI models are so enormous, and have become so tightly integrated into all aspects of urban living that it would be too difficult to build modern and efficient infrastructure, without Internet of Things (IoT) and fusion of meshed electronic sensors. 

So, unless fault tolerance and "exception handling mechanisms" are built by design, into modern infrastructure systems and logistical supply chains, those systems and supply lines will remain vulnerable to automated attacks from autonomous or remotely operated agents. 

In fact, the psychological motivations of a human agent in a given scenario, might eventually become comprehensible to ordinary onlookers and laypersons. But these days, even expert programmers of AI agents struggle to understand or comprehend why their AI model sometimes chooses to perform a particular set of steps towards a "short-term" or a "long-term" goal, that it computes or conceives, on its own. 

Existing synthetic AI agents, don't seem to have a psychological and sociological nature, even when they are programmed to mimic human psychological factors to emulate a "persona" or a "swarm." However, they have begun to manifest something different than animal or anthropomorphic personality traits. 

Things with advanced AI have started to exhibit surprising traits that seem to arise because of their internal models constructed from *multi-dimensional data,* and also because of *multi-spectral modes* of activities that the AI models are capable of performing in the real world, especially due to sub-nanosecond and sub-molecular scale interactions of networked components that constitute each AI unit. 

Most significantly, the ability of some of the exiting AI agents to predict the outcome of an evolving situation, or to suggest conjectures about outcomes from, say, a football match, or a car racing event, have become uncanny. 

Some of the current AI models available to policing agencies can even "speculate" about the behaviour of human beings gathered outside a stadium as fans of a football team, after their team wins or looses in a tournament. Data driven predictors of hooliganism, are obviously of commercial value to the police. Therefore, wouldn't it be much more significant to be able to predict *how, where, when, and by whom,* can a particular set of activities causally lead to a malicious or a terror attack? 

*Why* might attacks of any kind, ever happen, against a critical node within a supply chain? There could always be some type of a rational or a seemingly irrational explanation to why attacks have ever been conducted, or will ever be committed against an entity. But suffice it to say, offensive strategies and tactics do get employed by "mercantile groups and regimes" mainly for gratifying their personal sense of profit or payback. 

So...

### Imagine this scenario involving drones and airports

Right now, as a mere human being with measly cognitive abilities and ordinary skills, I can guess that commercially available aerial drones can be used for laying shards on the runway of an airport, just before a commercial airliner is about to takeoff or land, so that those metallic or plastic pieces with hardened and sharp edges can rip into the tires of the airplane resulting in a tire burst, or worse, get sucked into the jet engines, and thereby, cause a fiery incident on the runway.

<br>


[Such aerial drones](https://youtu.be/u2bQSKvZ2qI) could sneak into the airspace of an airport, lay their droppings, and then escape. The eventual "mishap" on the runway would take months or years to investigate. 

If any foreign objects on a runway were to cause a tear or a rupture in a targeted airplane's landing gear, fuselage, or in the engine, the death toll and financial loss from a crash could be sizable. 

<br>

>[!NOTE] 
>Do you remember how the entire fleet of Concorde airplanes disappeared after a fatal mishap occurred due to a piece of metal on the runway? A foreign object ripped a tire during the airplane's takeoff, and then the debris from the tires ruptured the vehicle's fuel tank, causing the plane to become a fireball that crashed into a building, killing 109 people, i.e. all 100 passengers, 5 crew members, and 4 other people on the ground.

<br>

For sure, the span and pace of aerial-warfare with missiles, jets, and drones has become incredibly long-ranged and rapid. Aerial combat is usually at the span of thousands of kilometers and at the pace of milliseconds, which is slow only in comparison to acts of cyber-warfare with botnets capable of launching computer viruses within microseconds onto a target country's infrastructure. But, sabotage of civilian infrastructure using items that aren't exactly weapons, is an issue that neither the police nor the military in any country is currently prepared to handle properly. This is mostly because neither of them are clear about the jurisdiction and responsibility for counteracting or investigating issues involving drones. 

One doesn't need to call the Navy to rescue somebody drowning in a swimming pool, but if that somebody happens to be a government bureaucrat who was attacked in his swimming pool and electrocuted to death by ghostly drones, then, who do you call? Ghost Busters? 

And, if two or more of such hypothesized incidents of airplanes crashing on the runway were to successively occur within a week, in a given city or a country, the airlines of that entire country could get grounded for a number of hours or perhaps days, depending on the severity of the crashes. Who would you call then, to resolve that type of an issue?  

So, if, and I mean, what if such attacks were timed during the Christmas and New Year holidays, when the airline industry in the northern hemisphere of the world is at its busiest? Would it cause the aviation fuel stockpiles at the airports to overflow after most of the airplanes in a targeted country become grounded? Consequently, would crude oil prices again become negative, during such an incident? Would it take only two or three airplanes in a single airport to crash within a week, or a single airplane each in four separate airports of a country, so as to completely bring down the country's airline schedule?

### The need for active countermeasures against unmanned vehicles

Many of the analysts, contractors, and sales people who had attended the recent Defense and Security Equipment International (DSEI) Expo 2025, were hoping to find anti-drone technologies or counteracting solutions for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). One could barely find any, and many of the available products on display for protecting tanks or fighter jets in the battlefield from drones, and alternatively, "human portable systems" to take down tiny UAS in urban environments, were only at the prototype stage. And none of the available ideas or prototypes for countering drones by smashing or shooting "the intruder" would be suitable for an airport, mainly because of the fragments that would litter the runway making the airport incur large costs for the clean up. 

A viable counter-drone tech, should be able to neutralize or take down an aerial drone, as early as possible upon detection, while keeping it as intact as possible. Moreover, directed energy beams as weapons, to disable a detected drone aren't yet available commercially. So, how might this critical task of counteracting drones become achievable, especially when modern aerial drones are capable of evading radio-frequency jamming signals by using fiber-optic line of control or "frequency switching and band hopping, comms architecture?" 

Truly, how does one detect a mostly plastic aerial drone, that has a volumetric size of a volleyball? In fact, *FPV Drones* tend to be smaller and faster than drones carrying an explosive charge. How can such small and rapidly moving things be detected "just-in-time" to knock them out of the sky? 

This task is analogous to finding a flying cellphone that has a very low heat signature against the backdrop of the sky, and is capable of moving faster than cars with suddenly changing flight trajectories, but at times, can move as slow as a walking or a standing person. Please note that, flying drones can also hide behind buildings or terrain, and within tree canopy, or simply land to become dormant, only to suddenly leap into action again.  

Indeed, across the world, none of the existing radar systems that are available as a part of the current airport infrastructure are tuned for this task. As such, new radar units will need to be commissioned and installed, that can be geared towards monitoring the entire perimeter and envelope of a given airport, for detecting drones. But then, how would those drones be taken down or deterred in a safe way? 

And what about the navigational flight paths and holding areas in each airport's extended airspace that lead in and out of a designated runway, how will that envelope of airspace be monitored for small drones? 

Most certainly there is a need for building and deploying an affordable solution for fitting radar systems or other opto-electronics on civilian and commercial airplanes, in order to monitor the volume of airspace in front of, or around, each airplane. 

Although more expensive, in the coming 10 to 15 years, if all commercial airliners get equipped with radar units tuned for detecting birds (biological agents) and drones (synthetic agents), airways can become more safe. 

However in the mean time, within the coming 2 to 4 years, there isn't much that can be done to stop aerial drones from attacking commercial airlines. 

<br>

>[!WARNING]
>The usual counter-terrorism efforts in each country are ongoing, for preventing attackers from ever launching a nefarious drone in the first place. But, you may be able to guess that right about now, there are groups of professional mercenaries around the world, **who would be willing and able to attack airlines connecting Israel to various other countries, inside those seemingly secure countries, by using drones.**  

<br> 

There are most probably other reasons or hot-button issues that could motivate random groups of amateur combatants and "irregular" militia to join the so-called war effort in their region against any invading regime, to use drones for directing attacks against the perceived enemy. For instance: Saudi-Yemeni issues concerning the airspace around the Red Sea; or the Jammu and Kashmir issue pertaining to India's and Pakistan's airspace; or the Tibet and Taiwan issues pertaining to China's airspace; Estonia-Latvia-Belarus-Bosnia-Moldova-Poland-Ukraine-Russia issue pertaining to European airspace; and so on and so forth.  

Also worth considering, what if kids playing with drones unintentionally cause a commercial airplane to crash because their innocent drone happened to be flying near an airport, or at an altitude where it could intercept an airplane? 

Hmmm... at present it may seem as if the global airline industry is at the mercy of teenagers not exercising their whimsical desires to do mischief with drones. Trains obviously can't get taken down so easily with tiny drones, but maybe railway signaling boxes can be disrupted by using attack drones in "clever ways." 

And what about naval ship yards and docks, or government buildings like courthouses and police stations, or hospitals and bridges and dams and electrical substations, all of which are similarly vulnerable to attacks from aquatic or terrestrial drones as well as aerial ones? 

Oh, well, que sera sera!

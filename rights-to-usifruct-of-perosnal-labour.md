[Usifruct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usufruct) is a word that alludes to the conjoined meanings of the words utility and fruitfulness, in the sense of: economically and lawfully utilizable outputs from material and intellectual properties, and from labour. However, recognizable properties and labour may or may not be "owned" by the person enjoying the usefulness and fruitfulness derived from the said properties and labour. 

Even if any equity is owned by a person, it might be owned under an assumed pseudonym or an alias, instead of their legally recognizable name and official title. 

Now, it is possible that you have heard some version of the phrase, "One does not have a right to the fruits of their labour but only has a right to perform labour." Most probably because you've read the Bhagvad Gita, or because you saw some meme on a social media post with that kind of a saying. 

This naturally prompts the question, "Who in the universe has a right to own and utilize the labours and work outputs of a person?" 

Especially, when the output of a task is the input to the next task of a person performing their duty-bound labour, then who has the equitable rights of ownership to the inputs, processes, production tools, works in progress, and outputs linked to a person's publicly or privately performed labours? 

Any capitalist or communist or monarchist overlord could end up stealing and unscrupulously enjoying your hard earned equity, if you don't bother to lay claim to your royalties and emoluments. So, you might as well assert your ownership of profits and losses derived from your earnest labours and material properties, and strictly protect them from thieves and invaders, with all the power and courage you can muster.

The lawful equity belonging to a person, naturally includes all possible assets and liabilities that can be rightfully attested and attributed as belonging to, the individuated corporal entity with personhood, who contributed to the creation of, or lawfully inherited, the practically measurable equity. 

So, could [the sage advice from Baghvad Gita about ownership of the fruits of one's labours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita#Chapter_3:_Karma_Yoga_(43_verses)) be applicable to enterprise corporate entities, nation-states, government organizations, robots with generative capacities, and unregistered associations of persons? How rational and worthwhile would that be?  

Perhaps, we must first take a step back, to explore the inner meanings of the phrase, "You have a right to labour that is performed with devotion and without a sense of attachment to the fruits of that labour." 

The most crucial word in this discussion is, "devotion" (श्रद्धा पूर्वक अभ्यास या अध्ययन, एवं भक्ति). And to understand this word, we can start with "idle curiosity." 

Every cognitive being with any level of consciousness has an innate curiosity, to direct its attention towards anything that peaks its interest. 

Since, mere curiosity is bound to move a being into action, in one or the other direction, at one or the other point of time, due to one or the other stimulus, it can entirely be taken for granted, that such actions borne out of curiosity come naturally and with ease, to the inquisitive being. 

Will curiosity kill you? Well, the lack of curiosity won't help you live. So, you might as well appreciate your innate and intrinsic level of curiosity, especially about the world in and around yourself.   

And as soon as that appreciation bumps into any level of resistance or a hurdle, your own capacity to overcome that obstacle will gear into action, and will move you towards the more interesting things that you value and care about. 

So, any amount of care you invest towards appreciating a thing or a person, helps you build a stronger relationship with that thing and person. Of course, this immediately prompts the next most important question, "What is the safest and most worthy being to have a relationship with?" 

You might as well answer that question for your own sake, in the manner that is most meaningful and suitable for you. This is because, as soon as you start to explore that question, you will come to appreciate the meaning of the words called "risk" and "uncertainty." 

Risks and uncertainty will aptly guide you towards safety and security. Whether you are risk-averse, or risk-taking, whether you do or don't have the analytical aptitude to evaluate risks that you can or cannot handle, as soon as you start to look for strength, stability, surety, and sustainability, you will move towards gaining the things in life that will grant you the correct answers as a reward, to the most important and significant questions pertaining to the successful furtherance of your fruitful life. 

This is how, your idle curiosity will transcend tiny hurdles via your capacity to direct your focused attention towards those things, and persons, that you genuinely care about, such as yourself and your family and your heritage and your ecology. 

Your capacity to direct your interests to address your wants and needs will improve, along with your ability to become intentionally committed to addressing those envisioned and inspired goals that interest you and your community. The ability to perform actions with any level of commitment towards a goal or an outcome, through your creative labours, will improve your faculties and sense of being, to achieve worthwhile and sustainable outcomes, especially when the fruits of your labour rightfully belong to you, as useful inputs to your next set of commitment based actions. 

Those commitment based actions in turn, will improve your capacity to perform dedicated tasks. "Dedicated to what exactly?", you may ask. Dedicated to that which is worthy of dedication, as per your imbibed cultural norms and values, while being sincerely earnest and truthful. Whether you manage to follow your passion or not, your conscience at least, will not lie to you, it will not deceive you, unless it is asleep or hypnotized. So follow your conscience before you follow any so-called passion. And even if your subconscious self is asleep, or hypnotized, it won't stay that way for long, because there are too many things in this universe that will rudely awaken it, and jostle it into full-fledged and dedicated actions to fulfill your birth rights. 

Whether you are young or old, male or female, professionally employed or merely an amateur dabbling in the arts and sciences of dealing with chores of daily life, you won't stay brainwashed or asleep for too long. This is because the forces existent in this universe that arise from the very basis of this universe, will demolish every form of falsehood and illusory deception that might have enthralled you. 

With such vital and crucial knowledge, you can rest assured that any so-called "guru" or "pundit" who gives you vacuous [solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism) about "know thy self", will be utterly destroyed and wiped out by the ever present forces, that gave birth to energy, matter, and time and space.

So, once you mature and manage to utilize your natural curiosity to move towards intentional activities, in a committed and dedicated way, you will eventually become a force of nature devoted to The Truth, and you won't merely remain a being with an agency to perform planned or reflexive actions towards achieving goals or visions. 

All of this, indeed, might also be applicable to networked robots with swarm intelligence and generative capacities.

<p><sub><strong>And we are "devoted" to The Logical Truth! LOL</strong></sub></p>

Much like the force called gravity, which doesn't seem to have a visible force-field through which it operates, although that field permeates throughout the universe, or similarly like the force called electromagnetism, which can be gauged or measured under specific conditions using scientific instruments but is otherwise, invisible, you as a force of goodness in your field, may remain invisible and even unimaginable, to the uninitiated. 

They, who never noticed or understood you, need not be blamed, for it was not their time or place to be able to do so. They will continue to be a sign belonging to The Ultimate Creator of this universe, and will shine upon you, as you are a similar sign or a signal to them, and will likewise, continue to shine upon them. 

Therefore, over time, as your curiosity turns into commitment which will then turn into dedication, the next consequent step is devotion. 

So, the safest and best Entity with whom you can form a relationship with, a Being who will never let you down because of negligence, or torment you with treachery and malice, is The One that brought you, your parents, your kinship, and also the entire universe into existence. The Name of That Being, is for you to discern, and to utter, if you so desire out of devotion. The stronger your relationship with That Being continues to grow and evolve, via devotion, the easier it will be for you to focus on and perform your rightful duties on this earth, in peace and with contentment, regardless of the transient outcomes. 

Whether you do or you don't have any emotional attachments to any of the envisioned outcomes derived from your labours and properties, and whether you did or you did not have your rightful equities duly credited to you with dignity by earthly beings, you will always be unconditionally loved by your Supreme Creator, and will most certainly receive due respect, due recompense, and due justice by the designs of your Ultimate Lord. That, my dear, is certain!
